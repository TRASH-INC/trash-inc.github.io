Lexi Graboski ([@LexiGraboski](https://www.instagram.com/lexigraboski)) has a resume full of TV, film and theater work, but is still plenty busy when she’s not acting. Namely, she’s creating behind the camera – including writing and producing her own sketch comedy series and showing her short film. According to Lexi, exploring various modes of storytelling and roles within filmmaking enhance the perspective she brings to each new project.

Lexi tells TRASH about how comedy allows space to play with how people perceive her,the impact of your friendships on the quality of one’s creative life and the pleasure of practicing skills unrelated to your jobs.

### Thank you for being a TRASH Angel. Will you tell us about a moment of creative transcendence that made you feel like you “earned your halo?”

There are certainly moments of magic where I feel like I almost blackout while acting, or when a photo film shoot came out exactly how I imagined. Those moments are gold, and they keep me going.

There are other lessons I learn that continue to affect me as a creative person. The more I put these lessons into practice, the more my work starts to click.

Certainly learning to be myself and not what I think others, such as  producers and casting directors, want me to be has been a huge lesson. The moments I really decide to trust myself spawn some of the projects I'm most proud of, including photo shoots I’ve styled, comedic sketches I’ve created and plays I’ve produced.

I just try to ask myself, “Am I surrounding myself with the right people? Am I trusting the right people?” Recently I stumbled across a quote about this that really hit me, by the writer and poet R.H. Sin: "You've always been good enough, you've just been giving the best parts of you to the wrong people."

There was a moment about a year and a half ago when I almost gave up on certain dreams and changed career paths. I started looking at grad schools. It took considering this change to sort of make me realize there was so much left for me to explore here in Los Angeles. I constantly check in with myself to remember why I am doing what I'm doing. I'm in an ongoing process to create the life I want to live.

More recently, I’ve been dabbling in stand-up comedy, and it really helped me understand how others perceive me and what my brand is. The juxtaposition between how we appear and how we feel can really define us, and can make for some fun comedy!
