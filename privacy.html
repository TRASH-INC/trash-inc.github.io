  <h1 class="text-block-2 heading">Privacy Policy</h1>
  <div class="div-block">

  <div class="text-block-2">
    <p>We at TRASH INC. (“TRASH”) know you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously.  Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. <strong>By using or accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.</strong></p>


      <p>Remember that your use of TRASH’s Services is at all times subject to the Terms of Use, which incorporates this Privacy Policy.  Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Use.</p>

     <h3 class="header">What does this Privacy Policy cover?</h3>
     <p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage.  We gather various types of Personal Information, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our services, to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below.</p>

      <p>As noted in the Terms of Use, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at: <a class="external"  href="mailto:support@trash.app">support@trash.app</a></p>


  <h3 clsas="header">Will TRASH ever change this Privacy Policy?</h3>
  <p>We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on <a class="external" target="_blank" href="http://trash.app">www.trash.app</a>, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them.  If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.  Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.</p>


<h3 class="header">What information does TRASH collect?</h3>
<p>Information You Provide to Us:</br>
        We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us.  Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.</p>

      <p>We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so.  For example, if you’ve given us your email address, we may email you about your use of the Services.  If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by emailing us at <a class="external"  href="mailto:support@trash.app">support@trash.app </a></p>

      <h3 class="header">Will TRASH share any of the Personal Information it receives?</h3>
      <p>We do not rent or sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone, provided certain Personal Information may be transferred in connection with business transfers, as described below. We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:</p>

      <h3 class="header">Information that’s been de-identified</h3>
      <p>We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual person. </p>

      <h3 class="header">Affiliated Businesses</h3>
      <p>In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us).  You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service.  We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.</p>


      <h3 class="header">Agents</h3>
      <p>We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you.  Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. </p>

      <h3 class="header">Business Transfers</h3>
        <p>We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions.  Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. </p>

      <h3 class="header">Protection of Company and Others</h3>
      <p>We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Company, our employees, our users, or others.  </p>

      <h3 class="header">Is Personal Information about me secure?</h3>
      <p>Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security.  You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p>

      <p>We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security.  Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>

      <h3 class="header">What choices do I have?</h3>
      <p>You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.</p>

      <p>You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained above.  When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.  You may request deletion of your account by emailing <a class="external"  href="mailto:support@trash.app">support@trash.app</a>. Some information may remain in our records after your deletion of such information from your account. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.</p>


      <h3 class="header">What if I have questions about this Privacy Policy?</h3>
      <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message to <a class="external"  href="mailto:support@trash.app">support@trash.app</a>, and we will try to resolve your concerns.</p>
