  <h3>What does this Privacy Policy cover?</h3>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information
    (“Personal Information”) that we gather when you are accessing or using our
    Services, but not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or
    people that we don’t manage. We gather various types of Personal Information,
    as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information
    internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide,
    and improve our services, to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain
    products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain
    cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only
    as described below.
  </p>

  <p>
    As noted in the Terms of Use, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal
    information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not
    attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about
    yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a
    child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If
    you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information,
    please contact us at: <a href="mailto:support@trash.app" target="_blank">support@trash.app</a>

  <h3>Will TRASH ever change this Privacy Policy?</h3>

  <p>
    We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this
    Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by
    placing a notice on <a href="http://trash.app"
    target="_blank">www.trash.app</a>, by sending you an email, and/or by some
    other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice
    emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those
    legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still
    responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after
    any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all
    of the changes. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy
    Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.

  <h3>Information that’s been de-identified</h3>

    how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can
    provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose
    aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner
    to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an

    affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we
    will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the
    extent that it is related to such transaction or service. We have no control
    over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to
    privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or
