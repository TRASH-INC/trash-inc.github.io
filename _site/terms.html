  <h1 class="heading">Terms of Use</h1>
  <div class="div-block">

  <div class="text-block-2">

  <p>Please note that your use of and access to our services (defined below) are subject to the following terms; if you do not agree to all of the following, you may not use or access the services in any manner :)</p>

<p>Welcome to TRASH! Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of the websites including <a href="https://trash.app">trash.app</a>, application(s) (the “<strong>App</strong>”), products, features, technologies, software and services (collectively with the App, the “<strong>Services</strong>”) operated by TRASH Inc. (“<strong>TRASH</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>” and “<strong>our</strong>”). If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these Terms of Use or the Services generally, please contact us by email: <a href="mailto:hi@trash.app">hi@trash.app</a>, phone: (201) 676-0329, or you can write to us at: TRASH INC, 37 Greenpoint Ave, Suite 219, Brooklyn NY 11222</p>

<p>These Terms of Use (the “<strong>Terms</strong>”) are a binding contract between you and TRASH. You must agree to and accept all of these Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the Services. Your use of the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services. These Terms include the provisions in this document, as well as those in the <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<p>ARBITRATION NOTICE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER: EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES DESCRIBED IN THE ARBITRATION SECTION BELOW, YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.</p>

<h3 class="header">Will these Terms ever change?</h3>

<p>We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the Services. We reserve the right to change these Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on trash.app, in the App, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.</p>

<p>If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.</p>

<p>Except for changes made by TRASH as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.</p>

<h3 class="header">What about my privacy?</h3>

<p>TRASH takes the privacy of its users very seriously. View the current <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<p>The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“<strong>COPPA</strong>”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a child under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hi@trash.app">hi@trash.app</a>.</p>

<h3 class="header">What are the basics of using the TRASH Services?</h3>

<p>We are providing you with the Services for technical evaluation purposes. This means that we will use your feedback and suggestions to change and improve the Services. This also means that the Services are not final, so we will continue to add features and updates as you continue to use and evaluate the Services.  Our license to use your feedback and suggestions is specified under the section titled “Do I have to grant any licenses to TRASH or to other users?”. </p>

<p>You may be required to sign up for an account, and select a password and user name (“<strong>User ID</strong>”). You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself. You may not select as your User ID a name that you don’t have the right to use, or another person’s name with the intent to impersonate that person. You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission.</p>

<p>You represent and warrant that you are an individual of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you’ve received your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the Services and gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf).</p>

<p>You will only use the Services for your own internal, personal, non-commercial use, and not on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party, and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the Services. We can’t and won’t be responsible for your using the Services in a way that breaks the law.</p>

<p>You will not share your account or password with anyone, and you must protect the security of your account and your password. You’re responsible for any activity associated with your account.</p>

<p>Any software that we provide you may automatically download and install upgrades, updates, or other new features. You may be able to adjust these automatic downloads through your device’s settings.</p>

<h3 class="header">Your use of the Services is subject to the following additional restrictions:</h3>

<p>You represent, warrant, and agree that you will not contribute any User Submission (as defined below) or otherwise use or interact with the Content (as defined below) and the Services in a manner that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Infringes or violates the intellectual property rights or any other rights of anyone else (including TRASH);</li>

<li>Violates any law or regulation, including any applicable export control laws;</li>

<li>Is harmful, fraudulent, deceptive, threatening, harassing, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable;</li>

<li>Jeopardizes the security of your TRASH account or anyone else’s (such as allowing someone else to log in to the Services as you);</li>

<li>Attempts, in any manner, to obtain or solicit the password, account, or other security information from any other user;</li>

<li>Violates the security of any computer network, or cracks any passwords or security encryption codes;</li>

<li>Runs Maillist, Listserv, any form of auto-responder or “spam” on the Services, or any processes that run or are activated while you are not logged into the Services, or that otherwise interfere with the proper working of the Services (including by placing an unreasonable load on the Services’ infrastructure);</li>

<li>“Crawls,” “scrapes,” or “spiders” any page, data, or portion of or relating to the Services or Content through use of manual or automated means;</li>

<li>Copies or stores any significant portion of the Content;</li>

<li>Decompiles, reverse engineers, or otherwise attempts to obtain the source code or underlying ideas or information of or relating to the Services.</li>
</ol>

<p>A violation of any of the foregoing is grounds for termination of your right to use or access the Services.</p>

<h3 class="header">What are my rights in the TRASH Services?</h3>

<p>The materials displayed or performed or available on or through the Services, including, but not limited to, text, graphics, data, articles, photos, images, illustrations, User Submissions, and so forth (all of the foregoing, the “<strong>Content</strong>”) are protected by copyright and/or other intellectual property laws. You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you access through the Services, and you won’t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of that Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else’s (including TRASH’s) rights.</p>

<p>You understand that TRASH owns the Services. You won’t modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section), create derivative works based on, or otherwise exploit any of the Services.</p>

<p>The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content. Please remember that just because this functionality exists, doesn’t mean that all the restrictions above don’t apply – they do!</p>

<h3 class="header">Do I have to grant any licenses to TRASH or to other users?</h3>

<p>Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services is your “<strong>User Submission</strong>.” Some User Submissions are viewable by other users. In order to display your User Submissions on the Services, and to allow other users to enjoy them (where applicable), you grant us certain rights in those User Submissions. Please note that all of the following licenses are subject to our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> to the extent they relate to User Submissions that are also your personally-identifiable information.</p>

<p>For all User Submissions, you hereby grant TRASH a license to translate, modify, adapt and edit (for technical purposes, for example making sure your content is viewable on an iPhone), host, store, reproduce and otherwise act with respect to such User Submissions, in each case to enable us to operate the Services, as described in more detail below. This is a license only – your ownership in User Submissions is not affected.</p>

<p>If you store a User Submission in your own personal TRASH account, in a manner that is not viewable by any other user except you (a “<strong>Personal User Submission</strong>”), you grant TRASH the license above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Personal User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Personal User Submission accessible to you and providing the Services necessary to do so.</p>

<p>If you share a User Submission only in a manner that only certain specified users can view (for example, a private message to one or more other users) (a “<strong>Limited Audience User Submission</strong>”), then you grant TRASH the licenses above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Limited Audience User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Limited Audience User Submission accessible to such other specified users, and providing the Services necessary to do so. Also, you grant such other specified users a license to access that Limited Audience User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services. Please note that if you share a mutual friend with another user on the App, then that user will be able to view your Limited Audience User Submission, and have a license to such Limited Audience User Submission in accordance with this paragraph unless you change this feature in your account settings.</p>

<p>If you share a User Submission publicly on the Services and/or in a manner that more than just you or certain specified users can view (e.g., if you upload a User Submission to the public repository), or if you provide us (in a direct email or otherwise) with any feedback, suggestions, improvements, enhancements, and/or feature requests relating to the Services (each of the foregoing, a <strong>“Public User Submission”</strong>), then you grant TRASH the licenses above, as well as a license to create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute your Public User Submission for the purpose of making that Public User Submission accessible to all TRASH users and providing the Services necessary to do so, as well as all other rights necessary to use and exercise all rights in that Public User Submission in connection with the Services and/or otherwise in connection with TRASH’s business. Specifically, this license gives TRASH the right to use your Public User Submission in connection with developing and training its artificial intelligence algorithm in connection with developing and providing the Services. To the extent necessary, when you appear in, create, upload, post, or send a Public User Submission, you also grant TRASH the unrestricted, worldwide, perpetual right and license to use your name, likeness, and voice. This means, among other things, that you will not be entitled to any compensation from TRASH if your name, likeness, or voice is conveyed through the Services. Also, you grant all other users of the Services a license to access that Public User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services.</p>

<p>You agree that the licenses you grant are royalty-free, perpetual, sublicenseable, irrevocable, and worldwide, provided that when you delete your TRASH account, we will stop displaying your User Submissions (other than Public User Submissions, which may remain fully available and which TRASH and other users may continue to in accordance with these Terms and in connection with TRASH’s business) to other users (if applicable), but you understand and agree that it may not be possible to completely delete that content from TRASH’s records, and that your User Submissions may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent that they were copied or stored by other users.</p>

<p>Finally, you understand and agree that TRASH, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Services to our users (including you), may need to make changes to your User Submissions to conform and adapt those User Submissions to the technical requirements of connection networks, devices, services, or media, and the foregoing licenses include the rights to do so.</p>

<h3 class="header">What if I see something on the Services that infringes my copyright?</h3>

<p>You may have heard of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “<strong>DMCA</strong>”), as it relates to online service providers, like TRASH, being asked to remove material that allegedly violates someone’s copyright. We respect others’ intellectual property rights, and we reserve the right to delete or disable Content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate the accounts of repeat alleged infringers. <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf">Learn more about the DMCA</a> and <a href="/dmca.html">view our copyright dispute policy</a>.</p>

<p>If you believe in good faith that Content posted on the App infringes your copyright, you (or your agent) may send TRASH a “Notification of Claimed Infringement” requesting that the material be removed or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the works that have been allegedly infringed;</li>

<li>Identification of the copyrighted work alleged to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the App are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works);</li>

<li>Identification of the specific material alleged to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow TRASH to locate the material on the App;</li>

<li>Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address (if available);</li>

<li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</li>

<li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send TRASH a counter-notice.</p>

<p>Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; <a href="http://www.loc.gov/copyright/">see here for details</a>. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the App should be sent to 98 4th St, Ste 401 Brooklyn, NY, 11231 or <a href="mailto:hi@trash.app">hi@trash.app</a>. Consult your legal advisor and see 17 U.S.C. § 512 before filing a notice or counter-notice as there are penalties for false claims under the DMCA.</p>

<h3 class="header">Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Services?</h3>

<p>Any information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such content originated, and you access all such information and content at your own risk. We aren’t liable for any errors or omissions in that information or content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it. We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services. We can’t guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services.</p>

<p>You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it. You will keep all your registration information accurate and current. You are responsible for all your activity in connection with the Services.</p>

<p>While we’re not required to do so, we may access, review, screen, and delete Content you contribute at any time and for any reason, including to provide and develop the Services or if we think the Content you contributed violate these Terms. However, we do not review all User Submissions, and you alone remain responsible for the User Submissions you create, upload, post, send, or store through the Services. TRASH does not take any responsibility for any Content you contribute through the Services.</p>

<p>The Services may contain links or connections to third party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by TRASH. When you access third party websites or use third party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that TRASH is not responsible for such risks. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party website or service that you visit or utilize.</p>

<p>TRASH has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third party websites or by any third party that you interact with through the Services. In addition, TRASH will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third party site or service. By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third party website or service.</p>

<p>Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties. You agree that TRASH shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.</p>

<p>If there is a dispute between participants on the App, or between users and any third party, you agree that TRASH is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release TRASH, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”</p>

<h3 class="header">Will TRASH ever change the Services?</h3>

<p>We’re always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We’ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical. Similarly, we reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.</p>

<h3 class="header">Do the TRASH Services cost anything?</h3>

<p>The Services are currently free, but we reserve the right to charge for certain or all Services in the future. We will notify you before any Services you are then using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services.</p>

<h3 class="header">What if I want to stop using the Services?</h3>

<p>You’re free to do that at any time, by contacting us at <a href="mailto:hi@trash.app">hi@trash.app</a>. Please refer to our (Privacy Policy)[/privacy], as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services.</p>

<p>TRASH is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms. TRASH has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.</p>

<p>Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account.</p>

<p>Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.</p>

<h3 class="header">I use the TRASH App available via the Apple App Store – should I know anything about that?</h3>

<p>These Terms apply to your use of all the Services, including the App available via the Apple, Inc. (“<strong>Apple</strong>”) App Store, but the following additional terms also apply to the App:</p>

<ol>
<li>Both you and TRASH acknowledge that these Terms are concluded between you and TRASH only, and not with Apple, and that Apple is not responsible for the App or the Content;</li>

<li>The App is licensed to you on a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable basis, solely to be used in connection with the Services for your private, personal, non-commercial use, subject to all the terms and conditions of these Terms as they are applicable to the Services;</li>

<li>You will only use the App in connection with an Apple device that you own or control;</li>

<li>You acknowledge and agree that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App;</li>

<li>In the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, including those implied by law, you may notify Apple of such failure; upon notification, Apple’s sole warranty obligation to you will be to refund to you the purchase price, if any, of the App;</li>

<li>You acknowledge and agree that TRASH, and not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims you or any third party may have in relation to the App;</li>

<li>You acknowledge and agree that, in the event of any third party claim that the App or your possession and use of the App infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, TRASH, and not Apple, will be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such infringement claim;</li>

<li>You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country, and that you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties;</li>

<li>Both you and TRASH acknowledge and agree that, in your use of the App, you will comply with any applicable third party terms of agreement which may affect or be affected by such use; and</li>

<li>Both you and TRASH acknowledge and agree that Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third party beneficiary hereof.</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="header">What else do I need to know?</h2>

<h3 class="header">Warranty Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Neither TRASH nor its licensors or suppliers makes any representations or warranties concerning any content contained in or accessed through the Services, and we will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or accessed through the Services. We (and our licensors and suppliers) make no representations or warranties regarding suggestions or recommendations of services or products offered or purchased through the Services. THE SERVICES AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED BY TRASH (AND ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS) ON AN “AS-IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THAT USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

<h3 class="header">Limitation of Liability</h3>
<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL TRASH (OR ITS LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS) BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR (B) ANY AMOUNT, IN THE AGGREGATE, IN EXCESS OF THE GREATER OF $100. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

<h3 class="header">Indemnity</h3>
<p>To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, you agree to indemnify and hold TRASH, its affiliates, officers, agents, employees, and partners harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from or in any way related to any third party claims relating to (a) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account), and (b) your violation of these Terms. In the event of such a claim, suit, or action (“Claim”), we will attempt to provide notice of the Claim to the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder).</p>

<h3 class="header">Assignment</h3>
<p>You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without TRASH’s prior written consent. We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.</p>

<h3 class="header">Choice of Law; Arbitration</h3>
<p>These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled in New York County, New York, in English, in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“<strong>Rules</strong>”) of JAMS/Endispute LLC (“<strong>JAMS</strong>”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction. For all purposes of these Terms, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, New York County, New York, or the Southern District of New York.</p>

<p>Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis: class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND TRASH ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local “small claims” court, if permitted by that small claims court’s rules and if within such court’s jurisdiction, unless such action is transferred, removed or appealed to a different court. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if we are a party to the proceeding. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of, related to or connected with the use of the Services or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim of action arose or be forever banned.</p>

<h3 class="header">Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that the TRASH may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You and TRASH agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and TRASH, and that it supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of TRASH, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind TRASH in any respect whatsoever. Except as expressly set forth in the section above regarding the Apple App Store, you and TRASH agree there are no third party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.</p>
