The goal of this workshop is to promote original research and provide a venue for discussion among active researchers in the intersection between human computation and computer vision.  Relevant topics include (but are not limited to):

   <ul class="lead">
   <li>Crowdsourcing image and video annotations (e.g., more efficient labeling methods, quality control)
   <li>Humans in the loop for visual tasks (e.g., recognition, segmentation, tracking, counting, etc).
   <li>Richer modalities of communication between humans and visual information (e.g., language, 3D pose, attributes)
   <li>Semi-automated computer vision algorithms
   <li>Active visual learning
   </ul>
</p>

We invite two types of submissions:

   <ol class="lead">
   <li> <b>Original work</b> not published elsewhere.  Papers should be submitted as 4-page extended abstracts (including references) using the provided author kit.  Accepted abstracts will be eligible for a best paper award and will be presented as posters with 5-minute spotlights.  Dual submissions are not allowed.  Reviewing will be double-blind.
   <li> <b>Previously published work</b> from a recent conference or journal.  Authors should submit an unrevised copy of their published work.  Accepted papers will be presented as posters.  Reviewing will be single-blind.  
   </ol>
