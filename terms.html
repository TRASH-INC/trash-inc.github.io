  <h3>1. Will these Terms ever change?</h3>

  <p>We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the Services. We reserve the right to change these Terms at any time, but if we do, we will post the amended Terms to the Services and update the “Effective Date” below.  We may also attempt to bring it to your attention by other means, including by placing a notice within the Services or by sending you an email notification to the email address associated with your account, as appropriate under the circumstances.</p>

  <p>Unless we say otherwise in our notice, the amended Terms will be effective immediately. If you don’t agree with the amended Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to access or use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.</p>

  <p>Except for changes made by TRASH as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.</p>

  <h3>11. I WANT TO UPLOAD VIDEOS, MUSIC, OR OTHER CONTENT - DO I HAVE TO GRANT ANY LICENSES TO TRASH OR TO OTHER USERS?</h3>

  <p>Yes!  Any content, including messages, avatars, text, illustrations, files, images, graphics, photographs, sounds, music, videos, Music Content, or other information or materials a user posts, uploads, shares, stores, or otherwise provides on or through the Services (collectively, “<strong>contribute</strong>”) is that user’s “<strong>User Submission</strong>.” Some User Submissions are viewable by other users. In order to display your User Submissions on the Services, and to allow other users to enjoy them (where applicable), you grant us certain rights in those User Submissions. These rights amount to licenses to your User Submissions only – your ownership in your User Submissions is not affected.  Please note that all of the following licenses are subject to our <a href="/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>) to the extent they relate to User Submissions that contain personally-identifiable information.</p>

  <p>For all your User Submissions (except any of Your Music Content (as defined below)), you hereby grant TRASH a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, unrestricted, unconditional, royalty-free, worldwide, fully-paid license to translate, modify, adapt and edit (including for technical purposes, for example making sure your User Submission is viewable on an iPhone), create derivative works from, host, store, display, broadcast, publicly perform, promote, exhibit, syndicate, distribute, and/or reproduce all or any portion of such User Submissions for the purposes of:  (a) enabling us to operate and provide the Services as authorized by these Terms and any Additional Terms; (b) making your User Submissions accessible to other users (where applicable); and (c) using in connection with developing and improving the Services (for example, in connection with developing and training our Services’ artificial intelligence algorithm) (collectively, the “<strong>Permitted Uses</strong>”), in each case, in any format and channels now known or later developed and with any technology or devices now known or later developed, and to advertise, market, and promote the same, without compensation, credit, or notice to you. Except as prohibited by law, you hereby waive, and you agree to waive, any moral rights (including attribution and integrity) that you may have in any such User Submissions, even if it is altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you.  To the extent not waivable, you irrevocably agree not to exercise such rights (if any) in a manner that interferes with any exercise of the granted rights.</p>

  <p>TRASH also offers you the ability to contribute certain original Music Content to the Services for possible incorporation into your and/or other users’ other User Submissions (such Music Content, “<strong>Your Music Content</strong>”).  For all Your Music Content, you hereby grant TRASH a non-exclusive, worldwide, unconditional, unrestricted, royalty-free, fully-paid right and license to host, store, reproduce, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, publicly communicate, create derivative works from, transmit, and otherwise make available Your Music Content on and through the Services for the purposes of the Permitted Uses.</p>

  <p>If you contribute any User Submission (including Your Music Content) in a manner such that other users can view it, then you also grant a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, royalty free, fully-paid right and license to such other users and to operators and users of any other third-party websites, apps, services, and/or platforms that are not owned or controlled by TRASH (collectively, “<strong>Third-Party Services</strong>”) to which your User Submission has been shared or embedded using the Services for the purposes of accessing and using that User Submission, as permitted by the features and functionality of the Services and within the use restrictions (if any) set by you in using the Services. This means, for example, that if you follow another user on the Services, then that user and any other users that user follows may be able to view your User Submission, and will have a license to such User Submission in accordance with these Terms and any Additional Terms unless you change this feature in your account settings.</p>

  <p>To the extent necessary, when you appear in or contribute a User Submission, you also grant TRASH the unrestricted, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual right and license to use your name, image, likeness, and voice. This means, among other things, that you will not be entitled to any compensation from TRASH if your name, image, likeness, or voice is conveyed on or through the Services.</p>

  <h3>12. WHAT ELSE DO I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT CONTENT I SUBMIT TO THE SERVICES?</h3>

  <p>By accessing or using the Services, you understand and agree that:</p>

<ol type=a>
  <li>You may not contribute any User Submission to the Services to which you do not hold the necessary rights! Any unauthorized use of material protected by copyright or any other intellectual property or similar right within your User Submission, whether it is unauthorized at the time you initially contribute it or becomes unauthorized at a later point, may constitute an infringement of the rights of others and is strictly prohibited.</li>

  <li>Except as specifically permitted by us in these Terms or any Additional Terms, you (i) have no right to receive any income or other consideration from any User Submission or your use of any Music Content made available to you on or through the Services, including in any User Submissions created by you, and (ii) are prohibited from exercising any rights to monetize or obtain consideration from any User Submission within the Services or on any Third-Party Services (e.g., you cannot claim User Submissions that have been uploaded to a social media platform such as YouTube for monetization).</li>

  <li>When you contribute User Submissions on or through our Services, your User Submissions and any associated information (such as your User ID or User Profile photo) will be visible to the public. You agree that (i) your User Submissions will be treated as non-confidential – regardless of whether you mark them “confidential,” “proprietary,” or the like – and will not be returned, and (ii) we do not assume any obligation of any kind to you or any third party with respect to your User Submissions.</li>

  <li>TRASH, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Services to our users (including you), may need to make changes to your User Submissions to conform and adapt those User Submissions to the technical requirements of connection networks, devices, services, or media, and the licenses you grant to us in these Terms or any Additional Terms include the rights to do so.</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section class="page-section">
  <h3>13. DO YOU PLACE ANY RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPE OF CONTENT I CAN SUBMIT TO THE SERVICES?</h3>

  <p>Yes. Each time you contribute any User Submission, in addition to the restrictions in Section 9 above, you represent, warrant, and agree that you are not contributing any User Submission that:</p>

<section class="page-section">
  <h3>14. I WANT TO UPLOAD MY OWN MUSIC TO THE SERVICES – WHAT ELSE DO I NEED TO KNOW?</h3>
<ol type=a>
  <li>Just because you authored a musical work (i.e., wrote a song) does not mean you have the right to contribute it to the Services or to otherwise grant the licenses in these Terms or any Additional Terms! If you only own the rights in and to a sound recording, but not to the underlying musical composition embodied in such sound recordings, then, you cannot contribute such sound recordings to the Services unless you have all permissions, clearances from, or are authorized by, the owner of any part of the content to contribute it to the Services. In other words, in order to contribute Your Music Content to the Services, you must own 100% of Your Music Content or have all the necessary permissions, clearances, and/or authorizations from the rightful owners.</li>

  <li>The rights you grant in Your Music Content in Section 11 above include, but are not limited to, the right to reproduce sound recordings (and make mechanical reproductions of the musical works embodied in such sound recordings), and publicly perform and communicate to the public sound recordings (and the musical works embodied therein), synchronize audio content in timed relation to audio visual content; all on a royalty-free basis. This means that you are granting us the right to use Your Music Content without the obligation to pay royalties to any third party, including, but not limited to, a sound recording copyright owner (e.g., a record label), a musical work copyright owner (e.g., a music publisher), any unions or guilds, and engineers, producers, writers, collaborators, side artists, band members or other royalty participants involved in the creation of Your Music Content.</li>

  <li>If you have assigned your rights to a music publisher, then you must obtain the consent of such music publisher to grant the royalty-free license(s) set forth in these Terms (and any Additional Terms) in Your Music Content or have such music publisher enter into these Terms (and any Additional Terms) with us.</li>

  <li>If you are a recording artist under contract with a record label, then you are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the Services is in compliance with any contractual obligations you may have to your record label, including if you create any new recordings through the Services that may be claimed by your label.</li>

  <li>TRASH may require you to answer certain questions regarding ownership of Your Music Content prior to allowing you to contribute Your Music Content to the Services. By contributing any Music Content, you, in addition to the other representations and warranties you make in these Terms, represent and warrant to TRASH that:  (i) all of your answers to such ownership questions and any other  statements made to TRASH on or off the Services regarding ownership of Your Music Content are accurate and complete (and you understand and agree that TRASH relies on the veracity of all such information to determine whether Your Music Content may be contributed to the Services); (ii) Your Music Content and the availability thereof on the Services does not and will not infringe or violate the rights of any third party, including any intellectual property rights, performers’ rights, or rights of privacy or publicity; and (iii) you have obtained any and all necessary consents, permissions, and/or releases to contribute Your Music Content to the Services, and to grant the rights and licenses you grant to TRASH, other users, Third-Party Services, and other third parties in these Terms and any Additional Terms.</li>

  <h3>15. WHAT IF I SEE SOMETHING ON THE SERVICES THAT INFRINGES MY COPYRIGHT? WHAT IF I RECEIVE A NOTICE OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT?</h3>

  <p>You may have heard of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “<strong>DMCA</strong>”), as it relates to online service providers, like TRASH, being asked to remove material that allegedly violates someone’s copyright. We respect others’ intellectual property rights, and we reserve the right to delete or disable TRASH Content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate the accounts of repeat alleged infringers. <a href="/DMCA">Learn more about the DMCA</a> and view our copyright dispute policy.</p>

  <p>If you believe in good faith that any TRASH Content or User Submission infringes your copyright, you (or your agent) may send TRASH a “Notification of Claimed Infringement” requesting that the material be removed or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A legend or subject line that says:  “Copyright Notice”;</li>

    <li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the works that have been allegedly infringed;</li>

    <li>Identification of the copyrighted work alleged to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Services are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works);</li>

    <li>Identification of the specific material alleged to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow TRASH to locate the material on the Services;</li>

    <li>Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address (if available);</li>

    <li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</li>

    <li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send TRASH a counter-notice.</p>

  <p>Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; <a href="/DMCA">see here for details</a>. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Services should be sent to 98 4th St, Ste 401 Brooklyn, NY, 11231 or <a href="mailto:hi@trash.app">hi@trash.app</a>. Consult your legal advisor and see 17 U.S.C. § 512 before filing a notice or counter-notice as there are penalties for false claims under the DMCA.</p>

  <p>If there is a dispute between users, or between users and any third party, you agree that TRASH is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release TRASH, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”</p>

  <h3>17. WILL TRASH EVER CHANGE OR UPGRADE THE SERVICES?</h3>
  <p>We’re always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We’ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical. Similarly, we reserve the right to remove any TRASH Content or User Submission from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that User Submission in violation of these Terms or any Additional Terms) or no reason, in our sole discretion, and without notice.</p>

  <p>Also, any software that we provide you may automatically download and install upgrades, updates, or other new features. You may be able to adjust these automatic downloads through your device’s settings.</p>

  <p>Account termination may result in destruction of any TRASH Content or User Submissions associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account.</p>

  <p>Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.</p>
