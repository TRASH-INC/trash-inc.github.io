      We‚Äôre glad you asked! Styles are basically video recipes that make it
      easier to create. For example, if you select "Selfie" or "Night Out", your
      video will be edited in a way that makes a great Selfie or Night Out
      video. Play around with them to find your signature style! ü§ó
