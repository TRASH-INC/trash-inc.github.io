<h1>Community Rulez</h1>

<section class="page-section">
  <h2>The tl;dr</h2>

  <p>We value self expression and creativity here.</p>

  <p>However, this is the kinda party where people respect each other. We have <strong>five rules</strong> you must adhere to.<strong> Break them and the bouncer will throw you outta the club.</strong> 😁🚪</p>

  <ol>
    <li>👀 Don’t share anything you wouldn’t want shared</li>
    <li>🚫 No R-rated content, this is a PG-13 movie</li>
    <li>🤐 If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all</li>
    <li>🙅🏻‍♀️Don’t be a jerk, abuse is not tolerated</li>
    <li>👆🏽Report any rule-breakers</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>The Breakdown</h2>

  <section class="page-section">
    <h3>1. Don’t share anything you wouldn’t want shared</h3>

    <p class="u-margin-top--small">Are you invading someone’s privacy by sharing that video? Would you be okay with someone else sharing that video of you? Be mindful of the subjects and content in your videos. If your mama wouldn’t be proud, you should probs keep it to yourself.</p>

    <h3>2. No R-rated content, this is a PG-13 movie</h3>

    <p class="u-margin-top--small">It doesn’t have to be squeaky clean, but let’s keep things tasteful.</p>

    <h3>3. If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all</h3>

    <p class="u-margin-top--small">Constructive criticism is welcome (if asked for), but only if done so respectfully. Community comes first here. If you wouldn’t say it to someone’s face, you probs shouldn’t comment it either.</p>

    <h3>4. Don’t be a jerk, abuse is not tolerated</h3>

    <p class="u-margin-top--small">Don’t be that person at the party. Nobody likes them. If you are that person, we’ll have to throw you out. There is <strong>zero tolerance</strong> for harassment, bullying, hate speech, threats, or violence of any kind on TRASH.</p>

    <h3>5. Report any rule-breakers</h3>

    <p class="u-margin-top--small">If you see something, say something! It’s our collective responsibility to help foster a safe, fun, creative space. If you see someone breaking these rules, report it using the three dot menu on any content or tell the bouncer and email <a href="mailto:bouncer@trash.app" target="_blank">bouncer@trash.app</a>.</p>
